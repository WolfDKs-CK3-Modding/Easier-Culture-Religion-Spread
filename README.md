# Easier-Culture-Religion-Spread

# Features
- Makes Convert County automatically move on to other counties that need conversion
- Adds decision to start conversion, so you don't have to find a valid target.

## Planned Features
See the GitHub Issues, for issues marked with "Enhancement" label.

## Want my mod to support your languages?
If that is the case, then follow this short list, and add the missing translations.

1. Fork This Repository.
2. Make the nececarry localization files and translations.
3. Create a Pull Request, wherein you explain the changes you have made i.e which language you have made support for.

For this to work, CK3 has to support the language, so do keep that in mind.

# Incompatibility
- Due to how it is coded, any mod that changes the Conversion Task, will be incompatibility, without a patch.

# Issues/Bug
If you encounter a bug/issue with my mod, check that you do not have something else installed, that the mod is incompatible with.
If you still have problems after this, then create an issue on the GitHub related to this mod. (https://github.com/WolfDKs-CK3-Modding/Easier-Culture-Religion-Spread)
You can also write a comment on the steam workshop page, but it is more likely I will respond, if it is on a GitHub issue.
