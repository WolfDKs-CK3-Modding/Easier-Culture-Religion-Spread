[h1] Planned Features [/h1]

See the [url=https://github.com/WolfDKs-CK3-Modding/Easier-Realm-Management/issues] GitHub Issues [/url], for issues marked with "Enhancement" label. Issues marked with "Enhancement" also tend to have another label, indicating for which version of the mod, I am planning to have that feature implemented in.

[h2] Other Noticeable Labels [/h2]

Some issues might be marked with a "Suggestion" label, in which case I would love to get input on, if others would like that change. The "Suggestion" label, is both for feature suggestions, that I haven't accepted yet, and for Suggested code changes, to improve the mod in general.

Another important label is the "Question" label. This label I will add to issues involving questions by either me or others, about some potential suggestion. Much like the "Suggestion" label, this label invites to conversation, centered on the question asked, and again I would love any input from others.

[h2] Want my mod to support your language? [/h2]

If that is the case, then follow this short list, and add the missing translations.
[olist]
[*] Fork the [url=https://github.com/WolfDKs-CK3-Modding/Easier-Realm-Management] GitHub Repository [/url].
[*] Make the necessary localization files and translations in your fork.
[*] Create a issue or write a comment to an existing issue on my issue page, stating which language you have made support for.
[/olist]

For this to work, CK3 has to support the language, so do keep that in mind.

[h1] Incompatibility [/h1]
[list]
[*] Due to how it is coded, any mod that changes the Convert Faith Task, will be incompatibility, without a patch.
[*] Due to how it is coded, any mod that changes the Promote Culture Task, will be incompatibility, without a patch.
[*] Due to how it is coded, any mod that changes the Increase Control Task, will be incompatibility, without a patch.
[*] Due to how it is coded, any mod that changes the Develop County Task, will be incompatibility, without a patch.
[/list]

In general look for section marked with "# Modified by Easier-Realm-Management". I place this comment above code I have added to vanilla overwritten files. This comment should help anybody who wish to make a patch between my mod and any other.

[h2] Ironman [/h2]

Due to the changes mentioned above, it is likely that the mod does not support Ironman mode. The changes are small, in comparison to other mods, and doesn't alter the final result of the tasks, so in theory Ironman mode should work, but I am not 100% sure.

[h1] Issues/Bugs [/h1]

If you encounter a bug/issue with my mod, check that you do not have something else installed, that the mod is incompatible with. If you still have problems after this, then create an issue on the [url=https://github.com/WolfDKs-CK3-Modding/Easier-Realm-Management/issues] GitHub issue page [/url].  You can also write a comment on the steam workshop page, but it is more likely I will respond, if it is on a GitHub issue.
